        <p>A super easy brownie recipe. Made with cocoa powder and <strong>three</strong> types of chocolate, this homemade brownies are fudgy, gooey and super chocolaty! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>185g Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>185g Dark chocolate</li>
            <li>85g Plain flour</li>
            <li>40g Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>50g White chocolate</li>
            <li>50g Milk chocolate</li>
            <li>3 Large eggs</li>
            <li>275g Golden caster sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl</li>
            <li>Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bbowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occassionaly to mix them.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperture.</li>
            <li>While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of the oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <lI>Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of kitchen foil (or non-stick baking parchment) to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run together and you get rid of any lumps.</lI>
            <li>Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.</li>
            <li>Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes depending on how powerful your mixer is. You'll know its ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. </li>
            <li>Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Mix until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown.</li>
            <li>Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Gently fold it all together.</li>
            <li>Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they're dotted throughout.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tins and put it in the oven for 25 mins. Bake until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the sides. </li>
            <li>Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.</li>
            <li>They'll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
        </ol>
